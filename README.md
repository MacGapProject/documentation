# Documentation for MacGap 2

The documentation is available at http://docs.macgap.com

### Contributing

We would love your help improving this documentation:

* fixing errors
* adding code examples
* improving wording

We would also like:

* CSS / HTML theming help (see http://docs.macgap.com for how it looks right now)

### Getting started

To contribute to the documentation, please clone this repository and submit a pull request like you would on any other repository.

The documentation is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). The page for each command is inside _posts and is written in Markdown format. Filenames must follow the syntax expected by Jekyll:

`YEAR-MM-DD-description.md`

At the top of each documentation page is a table of metadata which Jekyll uses to automatically build the navigation menu etc. It's easiest to simply copy this from an existing page then modify it, to get this right.

Jekyll automatically compiles the HTML output when the GIT repository is updated.

*If you would like full write access to this repository please add an issue in the issue queue.*
