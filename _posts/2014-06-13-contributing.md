MacGap is the result of hundreds of hours of time volunteered by people like you. If you have any of the following skills we could really use your help!

* JavaScript coding (help with documention, sample code, the documentation app, answers in the issue queue)

* HTML / CSS (help with theming of this documentation, theming of the documentation app's CSS, the public macgap.com site)

* Objective-C (help improving MacGap 2 itself, documentation, and helping on the issue queue)
